ERROR RESOLUTION LOG

ISSUE 1: Next.js Image Component in Client-Side Environment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ERROR MESSAGE:
   Uncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined
   at ../node_modules/next/dist/client/image-component.js

2. EXPLANATION:
   This error occurs because the code attempts to use the `next/image` component outside of a Next.js environment (e.g., in a Vite or CRA application). The `next/image` component relies on Node.js global variables like `process.env` and server-side optimization logic that are not available in a standard browser-based React setup.

3. SOLUTION CODE:
   (In src/components/Animations/AnimatedCards.tsx)

   // BEFORE (Causing Error):
   // import Image from "next/image";
   // <Image src={testimonial.src} ... />

   // AFTER (Solution):
   <img
     src={testimonial.src}
     alt={testimonial.name}
     width={500}
     height={500}
     draggable={false}
     className="h-full w-full rounded-3xl object-cover object-center"
   />

4. EXPLANATION OF SOLUTION:
   We replaced the Next.js specific `<Image />` component with a standard HTML `<img />` tag. The standard tag works natively in all browsers and does not require the specific build-time configuration or server-side environment variables that Next.js components demand.

ISSUE 2: Invalid React Child / Icon Library Conflict
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ERROR MESSAGE:
   Uncaught Error: Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {$$typeof, type, key, props, _owner, _store}).
   ... occurring in the <ArrowRight> component

2. EXPLANATION:
   This error indicates that a React component (specifically the icon from `@tabler/icons-react`) failed to render. This is often caused by a "Duplicate React" issue where multiple versions of React exist in the project (e.g., one from `next` and one from `vite` dependencies), or when a library is incompatible with the current build setup. The component is being treated as a plain JavaScript object rather than a renderable React element.

3. SOLUTION CODE:
   (In src/components/Animations/AnimatedCards.tsx)

   // BEFORE (Causing Error):
   // import { IconArrowLeft, IconArrowRight } from "@tabler/icons-react";
   // <IconArrowLeft ... />

   // AFTER (Solution - Inline SVG):
   <svg
     xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
     fill="none"
     viewBox="0 0 24 24"
     strokeWidth="2"
     stroke="currentColor"
     className="h-5 w-5 text-foreground group-hover/button:rotate-12 transition-transform duration-300"
   >
     <path strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" d="M10.5 19.5L3 12m0 0l7.5-7.5M3 12h18" />
   </svg>

4. EXPLANATION OF SOLUTION:
   We replaced the imported icon components with inline SVG elements. SVGs are standard HTML/JSX elements that do not rely on external JavaScript libraries or specific React versions to render. This eliminates the dependency conflict completely, ensuring the icons render correctly regardless of the underlying build environment issues.
