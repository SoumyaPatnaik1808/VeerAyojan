##🦁 Veer Aayojans (वीर आयोजन)

"Where the spirit of Veer Surendra Sai meets the energy of modern campus life."

Veer Aayojans is the ultimate club management ecosystem designed specifically for the students and organizers of Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology (VSSUT). It transforms the way clubs interact with the student body by blending a professional management tool with a "Mini-Twitter" social experience.

##✨ Project Vision

Our goal is to centralize the vibrant club culture of VSSUT. No more hunting through dozens of WhatsApp groups or missing physical posters. Veer Aayojans provides a streamlined, high-performance portal for every "Aayojan" (event) on campus.

##🌓 Dark Theme & Enthusiastic Design

The interface is built with a "Futuristic Dark" aesthetic—deep navy and charcoal backgrounds, electric blue accents (matching our Lion logo), and smooth, fluid animations that reflect the technical excellence of our institute.

##🚀 Key Features
